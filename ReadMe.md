# NHR Blackberry App

This is a weird historical experiment from the days when Blackberry Curve handsets were popular and was one of two versions of a mobile app I wrote for [NHR](https://nhradio.org.uk/). It's shared here after I found it on an old hard drive but really shouldn't be used for any modern purpose.

As the time it could stream MP3 audio, dial a phone line to make a request and feed whether you liked the song or not into [Radio Music Stats](https://github.com/steelegbr/radiomusicstats).
